Competition

Biologists all over the world use camera traps to monitor biodiversity and population density of animal species. They have recently been making strides towards automating the species classification challenge in camera traps, but as they try to expand the scope of these models from specific regions where they have collected training data to nearby areas we are faced with an interesting probem: how do you classify a species in a new region that you may not have seen in previous training data? 

Data

In order to tackle this problem, the competition organizers have prepared a challenge where the training data and test data are from different regions, namely The American Southwest and the American Northwest. The species seen in each region overlap, but are not identical, and the challenge is to classify the test species correctly.
